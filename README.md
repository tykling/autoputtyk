autoputtyk
==========
A small autohotkey script to show a menu of all the saved PuTTy sessions from registry when a hotkey is pressed.

Configuration
==============
The hotkey can be set near the top of the script where the variable Menu_Hotkey is defined. The default is #a which means win-a. There is a key reference at http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm

If your PuTTy executable is not located in c:\putty\putty.exe you need to specify the path as an argument to the script.
